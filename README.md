# coin-rotation-paradox

I've been enjoying watching Veritasium youtube channel, as well as other amazing science channels. Recently he posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHkTs-Ipfg) which gave me a couple of white nights trying to come up with an understanding of this problem.

This repository creates a video visualization of this "paradox", providing what I think is an easier way to understand it intuitively and may very well serve as a visual proof.
